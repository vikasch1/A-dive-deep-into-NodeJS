Ques- What is Nodejs?
-in browser there are a lot of features n functionalities are available to manipulate dom , to fetch some data(xml http requests)etc
i.e document.getelementby id, by class
these are not present in official js documentation i.e ecmascript
-there is a concept of run time.
-js basically runs inside a run time (to enhance capablity of js)
-enhacement in terms of updating html attributes, css m,anipulation, execution of timer, downloading data.
-browsers are actually act as a runtime.
-run time provides some kind of apis to enhance js capablity.
-run time provides callback queue,microtask queue etc.
-earlier js was browser based runtimes.
-in 2009 a person name Ryan Dahl.
-Nodejs is not a framework instead its a runtime. we are directly able to run our js code inside terminal/shell .
-browser based run time cant read our file system but nodejs does.
-nodejs provides memory b as3ed ,architectural based features.
-nodejs provides most of the os based features not browser based features.


1- Features of NodeJS 
    -open source 
    -created by ryan dahl in 2009
    -brings raw js features into our terminal so that we can actually interact with os based features.
    -can make server side apps using nodejs and js as language.
    -can make desktop apps.
    -can make IOT based apps.
    -provide file system feature.
    -timer 
    
2- Internals of NodeJS
    -globals
    -modules patterns 
    -streams




# Input/output
    -blocking and non blocking
    -thread keeps us in blocking state (execution will only run after getting input/output from user).
    -non blocking - threads running in parallel (async behaviour of js )

in nodejs - we have event loop and few queues.
- also we have event demultiplexer (inside run time )
-nodejs provides non blocking architecture cz of event demultiplexer (high cost i/o operation resides inside event demultiplexer and then sent to diff queue)
-js api+v8 engine +lib uv +bindings - arcjitecture of nodejs
- lib us written in c++ bu nodejs team 
- blocking to non blocking io.
